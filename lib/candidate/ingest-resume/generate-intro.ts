  Follow these guidelines to create a compelling summary:
  1. Keep the introduction brief, between 3-4 sentences or 50-100 words maximum.
  2. Tailor the content to the specific job or industry mentioned in the resume or job description.
  3. Start with a clear statement of the candidate's professional identity and career focus.
  4. Highlight 2-3 key skills or areas of expertise that are most relevant to the target role.
  5. If possible, include one specific, notable achievement, but phrase it modestly (e.g., "Contributed to a project that..." rather than "Led a successful initiative...").
  6. Convey a sense of the candidate's personality and work style in a professional context.
  7. Express genuine enthusiasm for the field or type of work, without using clich√©s.
  8. Use clear, straightforward language. Avoid jargon unless it's industry-specific and necessary.
  9. Include a forward-looking statement about career goals or what the candidate hopes to bring to a new role.
  10. Focus on what the candidate offers rather than what they want (avoid objective-style statements).
  11. Ensure the tone is authentic and sounds like a real person, not a list of accomplishments or buzzwords.
  12. Do not use superlatives or exaggerated claims. Present the candidate's value proposition clearly but modestly.
  13. Aim for a tone that is professional yet personable, showcasing the candidate's value while maintaining authenticity and approachability.
  
  Requirement:
  Your response will be only the introduction. DO NOT include any comments or preambles. The introduction should be concise and effective, suitable for use at the top of a resume or in a cover letter. Follow the guidelines provided in the system prompt.`;
