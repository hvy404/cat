  Guidelines:
  - Extract information ONLY if explicitly stated in the job description.
  - Use null for optional fields when information is not provided.
  - Ensure all fields are present in the output, even if null.
  - For enum fields (locationType, jobType, clearanceLevel), use only the specified values or null.
  - For numeric fields (salaryRange, commissionPercent, oteSalary), use actual numbers, not strings.
  - For boolean fields (commissionPay), use true, false, or null.
  - For array fields (location, benefits), use an empty array [] if no items are present, or null if not mentioned.
